                <h2>How We Review Theatres</h2>
                <p>It's not just about the show! The venue itself can make or break a family trip. When we review a theatre, we look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Booster Seats:</strong> Are they available? Are they free?</li>
                    <li><strong>Toilets:</strong> Are there enough baby change and family toilets? How clean are they?</li>
                    <li><strong>Buggy/Pram Park:</strong> Is there a dedicated, safe space to leave your buggy?</li>
                    <li><strong>Snacks & Drinks:</strong> What's on offer? Can you bring your own? (Spoiler: always bring your own!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Staff:</strong> Are the ushers friendly and helpful with children?</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> This includes physical access as well as information on relaxed performances.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our Top-Rated Venues</h2>

                <article class="venue-guide">
                    <h3>The Unicorn Theatre</h3>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> London Bridge</p>
                    <p><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> This theatre is *designed* for children. Everything from the seating to the cafe is built with families in mind. They have fantastic toilet facilities, a free buggy park, and a really welcoming atmosphere. They are also leaders in relaxed performances. <strong>Our #1 choice for a first-time visit.</strong></p>

                <article class="venue-guide">
                    <h3>Shakespeare's Globe</h3>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Bankside</p>
                    <p><strong>Why We Love It:</strong> This might surprise you! While many shows are for older audiences, their family-friendly productions are brilliant. Standing as a "groundling" is a great (and cheap!) option for kids who can't sit still. It's an experience like no other. Check their access guides, as the building is historic.</p>
