                        <h2>Welcome! I'm Katy.</h2>
                         <p>I’m a writer, theatre lover and mum of two.</p>
                         <p>I’ve been a journalist and features writer for more than 20 years. I’ve loved the theatre since I watched Meg and Mog live in the early 90s and I’m now mum to two amazing children.</p>
                         <p>Behind The Magic Curtain is a combination of the things I adore the most – writing and my passion for live theatre - and hopefully encouraging my children to develop that same love for the stage.</p>
                         <p>Having written What's On guides and reviews for many years, I was lucky enough to visit the theatre monthly, experiencing an enormous variety of shows and productions. Once I became a mum, I knew I wanted my son to experience the magic of live shows, but I realised I didn’t really know how to mix a toddler and the theatre!</p>
                         <p>Would he need his own ticket? What if he cried? Would he be able to see?</p>
                         <p>In 2019, when my eldest was two years old, we visited the theatre together for the first time. As we watched Ben & Holly at The Alexandra, Birmingham, little did I know that his beautiful, wide-eyed innocence, would inspire the name of this future project.</p>
                         <p>From the moment the show started, he was completely mesmerised. Usually a wild toddler, he never moved from his seat and never took his eyes from the stage. But at the end, when the curtain fell, so did his tears. As he sobbed he said; “Mummy please go behind the magic curtain and ask them to come back and see me for five more minutes.”</p>
                         <p>The magic curtain had transported his beloved characters from TV, to within arm's reach and as I watched him gaze at the stage in awe, I knew the magic had captured his heart.</p>
                         <p>From that day, he was hooked and I quickly threw myself into the world of children’s theatre, so that I could see his big brown eyes widen and fill with wonder as he watched more shows. As he's grown, our theatre adventures have continued, and we've also learned more about his unique way of experiencing the world, including his passion for shows, through the lens of his ADHD. This added a new, important layer to our visits: figuring out how to support his needs while nurturing his love for the stage.</p>
                         <p>Today, Behind The Magic Curtain is a What’s On guide to children’s shows across the Midlands and nearby. But it’s also become so much more. It's a place to share our journey and offer real-life, helpful advice to support other parents, especially those with neurodivergent kids, on how to make theatre an enjoyable and accessible experience for the entire family.</p>
                         <p>I aim to share and help publicise must-see productions, West End tours, and on-sale dates. Alongside that, I’ll be sharing practical tips for visiting local theatres with children and babies, a guide to relaxed performances, and specific advice on how to prepare for a show, manage sensory input, and ensure a stress-free, magical experience for everyone.</p>
                         <p>I will also include regular ticket competitions and giveaways!</p>
                         <p>I really hope you enjoy my page and reviews!</p>
