                <h2>Tips for Neurodivergent Families (ADHD, ASD)</h2>
                <p>As a mum to a wonderful child with ADHD, I know the theatre can feel like a challenge. But it's so worth it! Here are my top tips that have worked for us.</p>
                
                <article>
                    <h3>1. Look for "Relaxed Performances"</h3>
                    <p>These are a game-changer. The lights are often left on low, sudden loud noises are softened, and "shushing" is not allowed. It's a judgment-free zone where fidgeting and moving about is understood. Many major productions now offer them.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>2. Book an Aisle Seat</h3>
                    <p>This is my number one practical tip. An aisle seat means you can make a quick, discreet exit for a toilet break or just a "brain break" in the foyer without climbing over a whole row of people. It reduces my stress, which in turn reduces my child's stress.</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>3. Watch Videos of the Show and Theatre</h3>
                    <p>Fear of the unknown is a huge trigger. We "pre-load" by watching YouTube clips of the songs, looking at pictures of the theatre's inside (often on their website), and talking about the story. It makes it familiar and exciting, not scary.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>4. Pack a "Fidget Bag"</h3>
                    <p>A small, silent fidget toy (like a popper or tangle) can be a lifesaver for restless hands during quieter moments. Also, pack your own low-crinkle snacks and a drink. Theatre snacks are expensive and the queues can be stressful.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h3>5. Silent snacks</h3>
                    <p>You can still enjoy your favourite theatre treats but ditch the crinkly, noisy plastics. Transfer snacks into sandwhich bags or use tubs and pots to limit noise distraction.</p>
                </article>
             
                <article>
                    <h3>6. Don't Forget the Ear Defenders!</h3>
                    <p>This one may not apply to you or your little ones but for us, ear defenders are the saftey net. Having them and not using them provides the comfort and security that they are available if needed. Some theatres do have them however they could be in short supply or unfamiliar feeling so bringing your own is definitely the better choice.</p>
                </article>   
                
                <article>
                    <h3>7. Don't Aim for Perfection</h3>
                    <p>Did you have to leave at the interval? That's okay! You still went, you still experienced it. The goal is a happy memory, not an endurance test. Celebrate the win and try again another time.</p>

                <h2>General Tips for All Families</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check the Age Guidance:</strong> It's there for a reason! A show that's too "old" will be boring, and a show with scary themes can be upsetting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Go to the Loo... Twice:</strong> Go when you arrive, and then go again 5 minutes before the show starts. Trust me.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arrive Early:</strong> Rushing is stressful. Arrive with 30-45 minutes to spare. Find your seats, get booster cushions, and get settled without panic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Talk About "Theatre Etiquette":</strong> Explain simply: "We're quiet when the actors are talking, but we can clap and cheer at the end!"</li>
                </ul>
