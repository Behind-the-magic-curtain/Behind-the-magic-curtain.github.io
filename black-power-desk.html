                <h2>Our Family Verdict</h2>
    <p>There are so many powerful and hard-hitting lines in Black Power Desk that it’s difficult to choose just one, but “We are human first” captures the underlying humanity of this powerful piece of theatre perfectly.</p>
    <p>Black Power Desk is an extraordinary work of art, a retelling of history and yet devastatingly relevant today.</p>
    <p>The musical is set in 1970s London and tells a story rooted in real events from the British Black Power movement. This production doesn’t just look back at events in the past, it holds up a mirror to the present – a stark reminder of how dangerously close we are to history repeating itself.</p>
    <p>The musical tells the story of two sisters, Celia, played by Rochelle Rose and Dina, played by Veronica Carabai. As their families and community fear for their safety and survival, they demand justice and dignity.</p>
    <p>It’s a narrative woven with love and hate, fear and faith, resilience and resistance. At times, it’s incredibly uncomfortable to watch and rightly so.</p>
    <p>The language, the slurs, the violence and injustices are jarring and will make you wince, but the script and songs are presented with such raw honesty and emotional integrity.</p>
    <p>The use of real radio reports from the time pulls the audience even deeper into the tension and fears growing on the streets, whilst the silhouette of a mother pleading with police not to shoot her son, is a dark reminder of what communities faced – and are facing.</p>
    <p>Alongside the harrowing scenes and heartbreak, there are necessary laugh out loud moments, and true warmth. It’s thought-provoking, emotional, and utterly compelling.</p>
    <p>The cast are exceptional. Rochelle Rose and Veronica Carabai give phenomenal performances as the sisters. The supporting ensemble are equally outstanding. Alexander Bellinfantie, Tomos Eames, Gerel Falconer, Fahad Shaft, Chanté Faucher, Alan Drake, and Casey Bird, each one brings depth, energy, and truth to their role.</p>
    <p>The live three-piece band, blending RnB, Reggae and Soul fill the theatre with the sounds of a generation. The song writing comes straight from the soul — lyrical, passionate, and powerful. The lyrics are raw yet beautifully and often tenderly delivered, capturing both the anguish and the strength of both the individual and the community.</p>
    <p>The set design was exceptionally well thought out, with the police offices looming above The Drum, cleverly symbolising corruption and control — a literal 'looking down' on those deemed ‘beneath them’.</p>
    <p>No Blacks, No Irish, No dogs.</p>
    <p>Playwright Urielle Klein-Mekongo has created something remarkable. She said, “This musical was borne from a desire to delve deeper and discover the stories from Black British history that have been left untold. At its heart are two sisters, one who is an activist fighting for humanity and the other who wants to hold on to family and live their humanity without the struggle.”</p>
    <p>It’s harrowing to realise that what we see on stage was reality only fifty years ago and heart breaking to still see the parallels today.</p>
    <p>By the time the final note rung out, the standing ovation was instant and utterly deserved.</p>
    <p>Black Power Desk isn’t just a musical, it’s a call to remember, to reflect, and to do better.</p>
    <p>It needs, and deserves, a full UK tour and a West End run.</p>
    <p>This is a piece for the history books.</p>
    <p>Presented by Brixton House and Playwell Productions in association with Birmingham Hippodrome and The Lowry</p>
